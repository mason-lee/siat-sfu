						We're creating a new community based on integrating theory and application.

				<p>
					The School of Interactive Art and Technology (SIAT) at SFU is an interdisciplinary research focused school where technologists, artists, designers and theorists collaborate in innovative research and immersive study. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A degree in Interactive Arts and Technology prepares students to play a leading role in the conception of new media and the design of inventive technologies. 
					A SIAT education combines the science of human experience, the analysis of media and culture, the creation of original and experimental works of art, and the implementation of new technologies.
					Students bring these resources to bear on the most vital and innovative sectors of the economy, building the technologies and experiences that increasingly shape our lives.
				</p>
				<p>
					Central to the notion of this website is connecting current students and alumni of SIAT (members) to people looking for higher education in this field (visitors). 
					In order for people to better understand about SIAT, this website allows members to share their thoughts, ideas, experience and interests through their blog posts, Twitter timeline and Flickr Photostream.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once visitors sign up for our service, they can easily follow and un-follow our members without any limitation and receive updates about the members on their own personal timeline. 
					Receiving up-to-date information from members is especially important to our website because the field of technology is changing rapidly and most of our members are in the field where they constantly learn new knowledge and skills. 
					Therefore, visitors can easily comprehend not only the field of their interests but also how people from SIAT program live their life after their higher education in Simon Fraser University.
